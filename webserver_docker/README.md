# Premade Docker Image

Everything to recreate the docker image yourself for the webserver implementation.

## Why Crawl v 26.1?

This happened to be the crawl we were using at the time of development for the websocket connection. This API is likely to break with other versions of crawl. 

**Note that the source code for 26.1 is provided here so you can build the docker without cloning from git.**
